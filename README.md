# file-name-tagger
I use it to categorize random news or linux articles I find interesting
so the articles are organized by tag names rather than article titles

The vast majority of articles are from various web sites and saved to PDF.

This script will insert tag names into the beginning of file names.
The list of tag names may be edited or appended in the Main program
according to the general topic or subject matter.

Rename files with [ TAG NAME] [ FILE NAME ].
 
The tag names initially chosen for this script are on PC software and
hardware topics.

Required scripts: filename_tagger.sh, common_bash_function.lib.

Usage: bash filename_tagger.sh [ target directory ]
       (not sh filename_tagger.sh)
